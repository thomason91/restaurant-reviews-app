# Restaurant Reviews App - Stage 1

The Restaurant Reviews App (Stage 1) is a project included in Udacityâ€™s Front End Nanodegree program. In this project, students are required to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. Students begin with a static design that lacks accessibility and must convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. The project also requires the addition of a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Instructions

Download the repository located at https://github.com/thomason91/restaurant-reviews-app

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
